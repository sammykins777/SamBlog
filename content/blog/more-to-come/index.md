More to come. I have plans to try out some development things. Right now this is all hand-coded html and css. I would like to learn React, so I can make modular interfaces. I currently have all the elements such as header and footer copy and pasted into each html file. I'm prettys sure there's a more efficent way to do that.

I also plan on refining the look of this blog like adding tags for categorization. Along with the previously mentioned topic of learning an easy way to provide content to my blog. Maybe some smooth scrolling when I have more content to scroll. I have to go and watch a video of all this first.
