As previously mentioned, I had planned to figure out how to make this site with components. I had initially intended to use React, but stumbled onto Gatsby which uses React somehow. I'm still new to this so I just watch video tutorials and google stuff.

I was able to take the starter blog kit from Gatsby and style the header and style the background like my [original blog](https://thesamchronicles.netlify.com/). I made with just straight html/css.

What's really hard is javascript is involved with the rendering of all these components so you have to know javascript and how React works to get stuff to render. You also have to know where to go in the files to change things. Sometimes I have to go to the config file, sometimes I have to go to a component, etc.

Right now I'm strugging with how to just style the links like I orignally had in the site and also adding styling to the images like I had in the original site.

There's been great functionality added right out of the box with the gatsby blog starter kit. Gatsby's moto is to give you great sites fast so they have plugins you can use that "optimize" your images for your user. Still not sure how this works but I think it delivers up images based on what device you're on or what type of bandwith you have. They also had pre-built previous and next post tags that generate automatically when you add a post.

So far what I've gathered comparing this to writing a blog in just plain html and css to using a static site generator is you save a lot of tiem with the latter. It takes some spin up to understand how to use it when you are not that great at web development. With the little knowledge I have, I now can write and add my blogs in markdown and add it to a content folder with Gatsby. The hand-coded way, you have to write a lot more html syntax and make sure all the styles are being applied. So using Gatsby is definitely faster in that sense.

Well, I'm off to figure out Gatsby some more.
