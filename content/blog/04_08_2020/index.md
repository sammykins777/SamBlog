I've left my blog on the back burner. And now since I got laid off, I have time on my hands. 
Also, I'm just revisting this blog so I can remember how all this works. Coming up with content seems harder than learning how to use Gatsby and other services to post your content.

 I also will not be spellchecking super hard or worrying about my grammar. Yes, there are times when I confuse *their* with *there* or *they're* or *your* with *you're*. oH No, I'M a MoNSteR!

I've been spending a lot of times practicing JavaScript. I signed up for a second beginner course and realized that I should probably just try and figure out some JS problems on my own. 
Online training, associated slack channels, and web dev twitter have yielded some resources that seem to be helping with JS learning, but gotta admit, this will probably only be a hobby for me as I don't think I'll be able to learn enough in a timely manner to be employable. 

In case you were wondering what some of those resources were :

[Codewars]([title](https://www.codewars.com/)) - a place to practice writing algorithms, etc. I only use the training portion so I can get used to accessing arrays and solving the problem it presents. Still takes me hours to figure out the most basic problem. 

[execute program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) - is a training platform that uses spaced repetition. It helps you let fundamentals sink in by slowing down the learning pace and making you review a lot.  I've tried Free Code Camp, but that didn't work for me. FCC would go over basic concepts and then have you solve a problem immediately. The learning curve was steep and I drew a blank when trying to write the solution. Execute program seems to be that missing handholding I needed in between. This guy in the slack channel of the beginner course I'm taking told me about it. 

I was gonna give you a whole bunch more stuff, but honestly, I've got this delivery service app buzzing in the background and since I need to hustle to keep these bills paid, I gotta go.

P.S. My next goal is to add google analytics to this blog, so I can be depressed how I'm screaming into the internet void and no one is listening. 

P.S.S. If you want to spellcheck me or correct my grammar, you can head over to my [github](https://github.com/sammykins777/SamBlog) where I can figure out how to accept your pull request. Also, something I need to learn.
