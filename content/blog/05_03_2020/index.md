title: Google Analaytics Gave Me Problems

I just wanted to get some data on my website so I used the Gatsby Plugin for Google Analytics.
I had the link to my blog posted to my twitter profile. It had worked for a while, but today
twitter had flagged my site with a warning about malicious activity.

I THINK it was because I added google analytics, and I didn't add the pop up that Europe requires that says I'm collecting data.
Not 100 percent on that. But I removed the google anayltics plug in, in hopes that will clear it up. 
I'm still learning how to add the privacy stuff.
