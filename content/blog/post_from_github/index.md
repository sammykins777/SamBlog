I was wondering if it was possible to create a blog post directly from GitHub. This repository is linked to a netlify account and as soons as I make updates to it should publish my updates.
This would be an easy way to add blogposts to blog without opening up VS code.
It could also be a potential way to use github as a sort of down and dirty CMS in that a blog writer with markdown skills could add content direclty.

Here's hoping this works. 

Aloso there was a quick hack to make the folder structure that I needed. Actually, I'm not sure I need the folder structure for the blog posts. That's just how the demo version of Gatsby blog had it set up. 

But to add a folder then a file to github, here's the [stackoverflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository). 
I used the second popular answer.

**Sweet, it totally worked.**

Now anyone could submit a blog post if they wanted. 

The next thing is to:
- [] figure out how to accept pull requests or something? so if someone wants to contribute a blog or a code snippet I can accept it and fold it into the code. 

I love that github shows you what has changed. This was always confusing for me with the versioning in other places. Like on SharePoint. I think you could keep versions, but you couldn't tell what was changed. When multipble contributers use google docs, I think you can revert back to prior, but it doesn't show visually what changed, either. I don't think.
