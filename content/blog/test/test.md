# Attempting to add to blog directly from GitHub

I was wondering if it was possible to create a blog post directly from GitHub. This repository is linked to a netlify account and as soons as I make updates to it should publish my updates.
This would be an easy way to add blogposts to blog without opening up VS code.
It could also be a potential way to use github as a sort of down and dirty CMS in that a blog writer with markdown skills could add content direclty.

Here's hoping this works. 

Aloso there was a quick hack to make the folder structure that I needed. Actually, I'm not sure I need the folder structure for the blog posts. That's just how the demo version of Gatsby blog had it set up. 

But to add a foler then a file to github, here's the [stackoverflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository).
