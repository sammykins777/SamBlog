# Attempting to add to blog directly from GitHub

I was wondering if it was possible to create a blog post directly from GitHub. This repository is linked to a netlify account and as soons as I make updates to it should publish my updates.
This would be an easy way to add blogposts to blog without opening up VS code.
It could also be a potential way to use github as a sort of down and dirty CMS in that a blog writer with markdown skills could add content direclty.

Here's hoping this works.
