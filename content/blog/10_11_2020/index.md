Decided to take another stab at learning Gatsby with Wes Bos' course [Master Gatsby](https://mastergatsby.com/). I stumbled onto Wes Bos and Syntax FM thanks to watching Brad Traversy's Youtube channel.
This course takes you through building the front end with Gatsby to include CSS styling as well as connecting to a 'headless' Content Management System (CMS) and I think deploying it a few different ways.
I want to move toward making fully functional applications, just to see if I can do it. I have an idea for this local website I saw that does rentals. There web presence is old school.
Even though at the bottom, the company is being serviced by an agency. I mean I think they'd have better luck just moving to Wix or Squarespace or something like that. 
I would like to see if I can take the Master Gatsby course and turn into something real instead of a fake project. That would be the next step on this web development growth journey.
